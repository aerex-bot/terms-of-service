## Introduction:
Welcome to the official Aerex Terms of Service document. In here, you will find our terms of use and rules that you must abide by while using Aerex. If you have any questions, please reach out to us by [joining our support server](https://discord.gg/BYuUvE4).

## Prohibited Activities:
While using Aerex, you may not do _any_ of the following. If caught doing so, you will be immediately blacklisted from the bot.

1. You may not use a self bot, macro, user-bot, or any sort of method that automates your interaction with the bot.
2. You may not use Aerex to target others in any way, shape, or form. 
3. If you find a bug or a vulnerability, you may not disclose the bug/vulnerability to anyone and report it immediately to the developers. If given permission to disclose the bug, you may do so.
4. You may not use Aerex's branding anywhere without obtaining explicit permission from the developers. 
5. You may not use Aerex to advertise other services.
6. You may not use Aerex to distribute any form of malware, spyware, or viruses to other users.
7. You may not use Aerex to disclose private information of others (commonly known as doxxing).
8. The server you invite Aerex in must abide by the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and the [Discord Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). Harmful servers (such as bot farms, etc.) will result in immediate removal of the bot followed by a server-based blacklist.
9. You may not sell AirCoins for any form of actual currency (such as US dollars, etc.) or store AirCoins in an alternate account. AirCoins have no monetary value. However, you may give away AirCoins that you collected for free.
10. You may not spam Aerex. Spamming commands will get you blacklisted automatically by the anti-spam system and this action will generally not be appealed unless you have a very good reason for it.

## Reporting Others:
If you find out that an individual or a Discord server is breaking Aerex's terms, please feel free to report them. You may [join the support server]([https://discord.gg/BYuUvE4) and submit an anonymous report by Direct Messaging a staff member in the server, or by running the built in `report` command by Aerex. Both will ensure anonymity from the user you are reporting.

## Inquiries & Concerns:
If you have any questions or concerns about the Terms of Service, we will be more than happy to help you in our [support server](https://discord.gg/BYuUvE4).
